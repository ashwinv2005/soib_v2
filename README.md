# State of India's Birds 2023 

This repository contains the source code associated with the SoIB 2023 analysis, as well as all outputs that fed into the [SoIB 2023 report](https://stateofindiasbirds.in/#soib_report)[^1]. All analyses were performed in the R environment in RStudio, and with the addition of a couple of large (publicly available) data files that need to be procured externally (steps detailed here), the source code and files in this repo will allow the analyses to be fully reproduced.

The broad-level structure and workflow for the main analysis is outlined below. At certain points, finer-level details can be found in the appropriate sub-READMEs linked.
